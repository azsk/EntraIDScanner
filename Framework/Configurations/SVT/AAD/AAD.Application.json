      "ControlSeverity": "High",
      "Automated": "Yes",
      "MethodName": "CheckOldTestDemoApps",
      "Rationale": "Demo apps are usually short-term projects that do not go through the full engineering process and due diligence required for enterprise apps. As a result, it is important to constantly review and prune demo app entries from the tenant.",

      "ControlSeverity": "High",
      "Automated": "Yes",
      "MethodName": "CheckReturnURLsAreHTTPS",
      "Rationale": "Return URLs of an application are particularly sensitive because many authentication flows involve posting the token to the returnURL after successful authentication. If such a URL does not use HTTPS, it leads to disclosure of the token on the network in clear text.",

      "ControlSeverity": "High",
      "Automated": "Yes",
      "MethodName": "CheckRedirectURIsWithWilcard",
      "Rationale": "Allowing wildcard in redirect URIs makes it easier for attackers to get auth tokens from the app by creating similar redirect URIs and phishing users to malicious URLs. For public clients this can provide attackers directly with an access token whereas for confidential apps, attackers can leverage auth code injection attacks to get an access token.",

      "ControlSeverity": "High",
      "Automated": "Yes",
      "MethodName": "CheckDanglingRedirectURIs",
      "Rationale": "Allowing redirect URIs with no DNS ownership allows attackers to get ownership of the URL before the actual owners, enabling them to get auth tokens by phishing users to these sites under attackers' controls.",
      "Recommendation": "1. Go to App Registration. 2. Navigate to the app. 3. Go to Authentication under Manage. 4. Configure all redirect URIs and their DNS records.",
