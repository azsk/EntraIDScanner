      "ControlSeverity": "High",
      "Automated": "Yes",
      "MethodName": "CheckOldTestDemoApps",
      "Rationale": "Demo apps are usually short-term projects that do not go through the full engineering process and due diligence required for enterprise apps. As a result, it is important to constantly review and prune demo app entries from the tenant.",

      "ControlSeverity": "High",
      "Automated": "Yes",
      "MethodName": "CheckReturnURLsAreHTTPS",
      "Rationale": "Return URLs of an application are particularly sensitive because many authentication flows involve posting the token to the returnURL after successful authentication. If such a URL does not use HTTPS, it leads to disclosure of the token on the network in clear text.",

      "Rationale": "Allowing wildcard in redirect URIs makes it easier for attackers to get auth tokens from the app by creating similar redirect URIs and phishing users to malicious URLs. For public clients this can provide attackers directly with an access token whereas for confidential apps, attackers can leverage auth code injection attacks to get an access token.",

      "Rationale": "Using implicit flow, exposes the access token in the URL fragment, and does not support PKCE, making it vulnerable to access token leage and token replay attacks.",
      "Recommendation": "1. Go to App Registration. 2. Navigate to the app. 3. Disable access tokens used for implicit flows.",

      "ControlSeverity": "High",
      "Automated": "Yes",
      "MethodName": "CheckDanglingRedirectURIs",
      "Rationale": "Allowing redirect URIs with no DNS ownership allows attackers to get ownership of the URL before the actual owners, enabling them to get auth tokens by phishing users to these sites under attackers' controls.",
      "Recommendation": "1. Go to App Registration. 2. Navigate to the app. 3. Go to Authentication under Manage. 4. Configure all redirect URIs and their DNS records.",

      "MethodName": "CheckAppHasFTEOwnerOnly",
      "Rationale": "Owners of the app have access to critical app settings such as auth flows, credentials and API permissions. Providing ownership to FTE accounts only leads to better app governance and prevents malicious users from outside the enterprise from accessing critical data.",
      "Recommendation": "1. Go to App Registration. 2. Navigate to the app. 3. Go to owners. 4. Remove any non FTE account",

      "Rationale": "If client secrets are a must to be used, ensure that the secret expiry is not more than 90 days. Long expiry secrets can lead to unauthorized access for a longer window in case of secret compromise.",
      "Recommendation": "1. Go to App Registration. 2. Navigate to the app. 3. Go to certificates and secrets and delete any client secrets with expiry more than 90 days",

      "Rationale": "Apps should only require the least needed permission possible to prevent risky unauthorized access to enterprise resources. App permissions are riskier than delegated permissions as these do not require user consent.",

      "Rationale": "Apps without any ownership can either be legacy apps no longer being used or app whose owners have left the organization. If client secrets with secret expiry of more than 90 days are associated this could lead to a longer attack window of app compromise outside the enterprise. Ensuring enterprise security hygiene, either the app or the secret should be deleted and proper ownership should be defined.",
