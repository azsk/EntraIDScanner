Attackers can exploit this by creating fraudulent redirect URIs resembling legitimate ones, leading to potential phishing attacks and unauthorized access to authentication tokens.

      "Rationale": "Apps without any ownership can either be legacy apps no longer being used or app whose owners have left the organization. If client secrets with secret expiry of more than 90 days are associated this could lead to a longer attack window of app compromise outside the enterprise.
