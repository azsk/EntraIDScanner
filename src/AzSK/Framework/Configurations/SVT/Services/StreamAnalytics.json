      "ControlSeverity": "Medium",
      "Automated": "Yes",
      "MethodName": "CheckRBACAccess",
      "Rationale": "Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.",
      "Recommendation": "Remove any excessive privileges granted on the Stream Analytics. Assign 'Log Analytics Contributor' RBAC role to developers who manages Stream Analytics configurations. Run command: Remove-AzRoleAssignment -SignInName '{signInName}' -Scope '{scope}' -RoleDefinitionName '{role definition name}'. Run 'Get-Help Remove-AzRoleAssignment -full' for more help.

      "MethodName": "CheckDiagnosticsSettings",
      "Rationale": "Logs should be retained for a long enough period so that activity trail can be recreated when investigations are required in the event of an incident or a compromise. A period of 1 year is typical for several compliance requirements as well.",
      "Recommendation": "You can change the diagnostic settings from the Azure Portal by following the steps given here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-archive-diagnostic-logs#archive-diagnostic-logs-using-the-portal",

      "Rationale": "Using alert rules, one can ensure high availability of important/critical services by monitoring jobs and getting alerts for runtime errors and job failures.",
      "Recommendation": "To setup alert rule for 'Failed Function Requests' and 'Runtime Errors' events: (1) Go to Stream Analytics service -> 'Alerts' -> 'New alert rule' -> 'Add condition' (2) Select Signal type as 'Metrics' -> Select 'Failed Function Requests'/'Runtime Errors' -> Select a. Operator =  'Greater Than' b. Aggregation type = 'Total' c. Threshold value = '0' and d.

      "Rationale": "Paired namespaces help maintain consistent availability of a Stream Analytics based solution in case of an outage (e.g. throttling, storage issue, subsystem failure) in the primary region.",
      "Recommendation": "Critical jobs of Stream Analytics should be deployed to both paired regions. In addition to Stream Analytics internal monitoring capabilities, customers are also advised to monitor the jobs. If a break is identified to be a result of the Stream Analytics service update, escalate appropriately and fail over any downstream consumers to the healthy job output. Escalation to support will prevent the paired region from being affected by the new deployment and maintain the integrity of the paired jobs.
