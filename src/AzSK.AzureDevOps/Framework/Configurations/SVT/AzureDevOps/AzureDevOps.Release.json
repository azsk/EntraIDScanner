      "Id": "Release110",
      "ControlSeverity": "High",
      "Automated": "No",
      "MethodName": "",
      "Rationale": "Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.",

      "MethodName": "CheckCredInVariables",
      "Rationale": "Keeping secrets such as connection strings, passwords, keys, etc. in clear text can lead to easy compromise. Making them secret type variables ensures that they are protected at rest.",
