      "ControlSeverity": "High",
      "Automated": "No",
      "MethodName": "",
      "Rationale": "Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.",

        "Rationale": "Keeping secret files such as signing certificates, Apple Provisioning Profiles, Android KeyStore files, SSH keys etc. in repository can lead to easy compromise at various avenues during an application's lifecycle.
